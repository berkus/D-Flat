D-Flat Version 19

The source files in the DFLAT archive constitute the D-Flat windowing
system. This is public domain code. You may use it in your
applications without restriction. You may freely distribute source
code. It would be nice if you would give credit to Dr. Dobb's Journal
as the original publisher of the source code.

The software build procedure makes a program named memopad.exe. It is
a multiple-document notepad program. Observe the #define VERSION
statement in dflat.h. The version number should correspond with the
nn in the DFLTnn.ARC filename that you downloaded. Check the uploads
periodically to see if there is a more recent version available.

My CompuServe ID is 71101,1262. I monitor the DDJFORUM every day and
prefer that you discuss D-Flat there so that every one can benefit
from your comments.

============== Microsoft C 7.0

To build with Microsoft C 7.0, type this command

    C>nmake /f makefile.msc

========== Borland C++ 3.0 ============

To build with the Borland C++ 3.1 or 4.0 make utility:

Set the DRIVE macro in the makefile to the drive and directory 
where your compiler is installed.

Type this command:

    C>make /fmakefile.bcc

========== WATCOM C 8.0 ============

To build with Watcom C 8.0, type this command

    C>wmake /f makefile.wat

=======================================================

D-Flat uses Compressed help files. It uses an adaptation of the
Huffman compression programs from the Dr. Dobb's Journal C
Programming Column of early 1991. 

The makefile compresses the help file with these commands:

   C>huffc memopad.txt memopad.hlp
   C>fixhelp memopad.hlp

Both of the programs must be run in order for the help system to work
properly. Note that .hlp files from previous versions are not
compatible with versions 18 and higher. The .txt files are, however,
so you can use the huffc and fixhelp programs to rebuild the .hlp
file.

===============================================

This is version 19. It fixes these problems:

1. Applicat.c did not set the window height properly when 43 or 50
lines was selected with the result that the application window's
ClientHeight macro returned a value 1 less than it should have.

2. Dragging scroll boxes on documents exactly the width or length of
the window caused divide-by-zero errors.

3. The SaveAsDialogBox function now lets you specify an initial filename
for the display and a separate search path for the file list. Note the
additional argument to the function.

4. The DisplayDefinition function in helpbox.c opened and closed the
help database file even though the file is already open. It also used
the global ThisHelp pointer, which should have been saved and
restored.

5. Capturing and restoring the clock did not provide for chained and
returned captures. See CAPTURE_CLOCK message in dflat.doc for
details.

6. Changed text block marking display so that zero-length lines
display as if there is one blank character.

7. Non-Borland compilers would not compile direct.c because of
non-standard FA_DIREC global.
