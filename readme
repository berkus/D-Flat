   ***  README -  D-Flat  ***  

D-Flat is an old public-domain graphics library originally published in 
"Dr Dobb's Journal" way back in the mists of time, when men were real men, women were real women and small furry animals from Alpha Centauri were REAL small furry animals from Alpha Centauri.   

The library was originally written to run on DOS. I've put it here in the hope that either I or someone else will convert it to run on Linux and/or the BSDs.  

As usual, the code is in the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy....."  ;)
